This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, Server.

* [/app/iosApp](./app/iosApp/iosApp) contains an iOS application. Even if you’re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform,
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

* [/app/sharedLogic](./app/sharedLogic/src) is for the code that will be shared between app targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is [commonMain](./app/sharedLogic/src/commonMain/kotlin). If preferred, you
  can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.

* [/core](./core/src) is for the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is [commonMain](./core/src/commonMain/kotlin). If preferred, you
  can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.

* [/server](./server/src/main/kotlin) is for the Ktor server application.

### Running the apps

Use the run configurations provided by the run widget in your IDE's toolbar. You can also use these commands and options:

- Android app: `./gradlew :app:androidApp:assembleDebug`
- Server: `./gradlew :server:run`
- iOS app: open the [/app/iosApp](./app/iosApp) directory in Xcode and run it from there.

### Running tests

Use the run button in your IDE's editor gutter, or run tests using Gradle tasks:

- Android tests: `./gradlew :app:sharedLogic:testAndroidHostTest`
- Server tests: `./gradlew :server:test`
- iOS tests: `./gradlew :app:sharedLogic:iosSimulatorArm64Test`
